#### Introduction:
This project aims to provide a robust tool for performing data mining tasks while preserving the privacy of individual data points. By adding noise to the data, we can ensure that sensitive information is protected while still enabling meaningful analysis.

#### Features:
- **Differential Privacy:** Implements differential privacy techniques to protect individual data points.
- **Data Mining:** Supports various data mining tasks such as classification and clustering.
- **Versatility:** Tested on multiple datasets to demonstrate its applicability.

#### Datasets:
The tool has been tested on the following datasets:
- **Iris dataset:** A classic dataset for classification tasks.
- **Wine dataset:** Another classification dataset to test the tool's robustness.
- **Synthetic Adult Census Income dataset:** A synthetic version of the Adult Census Income dataset from UCI, used to demonstrate the tool's application to more sensitive data.

#### Installation:
To get started with the Privacy-Preserving Data Mining Tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [GitHub Repository Link]
   cd privacy-preserving-ml
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib jupyterlab
   ```

#### Usage:
1. Start Jupyter Lab:
   ```sh
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. Open the `differential_privacy_in_data_mining.ipynb` notebook and follow the steps to load, preprocess, and analyze the datasets.

#### Results:
The tool has been evaluated on the Iris, Wine, and synthetic Adult Census Income datasets. The results demonstrate that our privacy-preserving techniques effectively protect sensitive information while maintaining a reasonable level of data utility.
